They have replaced all of my pointers and are using them for mind 
control.   Visit the Grey Overlord Page for more information...

Installation:

If you are not familiar with installing OS/2 pointer sets here is
briefly how it is done.  You will find a subdirectory under your
os/2 directory called 'ponters', like this: /os2/pointers/.  Under
that subdirectory there will be other subdirectories.  Each
subdirectory under the /pointers directory is one set of OS/2
pointers. 

You can create a new directory there and put all the *.ptr files in
it, or if you go to the /pointers directory and UNZIP this archive 
the directory should be made for you.

After that open MOUSE notebook in the the SYSTEM SETUP folder.
There is a tab on the book for pointer sets.  You can load it from
there.
