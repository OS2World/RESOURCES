I just took Big White Pointers and that timeglass from somewhere else and made them bloody-looking. I got the idea for these pointers from some desktop picture I saw in World Wide Web. You can freely distribute and modify this set of pointers, but don't distribute these as your own work. And yes, this is FREEWARE. And don't take money of it. If you paid money of this product, none of it went to me or the creator of original Big White Pointers.
