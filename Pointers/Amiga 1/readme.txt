
To use these mouse pointers, move the directories AMIGA1 and AMIGA2 to 
the \os2\pointers directory, then select them from the Mouse Pointers
menu.
 
For example, say you have Warp installed on the C: drive.  You would 
copy AMIGA1 and AMIGA2 to the c:\os2\pointers directory, resulting in

  C:\os2\pointers\AMIGA1   and
  C:\os2\pointers\AMIGA2
 
To use the pointers found in AMIGA1, you would then...
 
 + Right click on the Desktop with your mouse.
 + Click on the Mouse icon
 + Select the Pointers tab
 + Click on the Load Set button
 + Choose AMIGA1 from the list
 + Click on Load

That's it!  To use any of the other sets, just select them from the Load Set
menu.
