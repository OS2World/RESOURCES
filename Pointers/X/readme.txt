This is another attempt at making X-like pointers. I saw a few versions on the net, but they were not what I wanted, so I made my own. These icons are based on the X-windows pointers under the Motif window magager. When used together with NPSWPS Enhancer and/or FeelX, they make a more realistic X look and feel. Some pointers like the ILLEGAL.PTR I had to make up, 'cause I 'aint seen no "illegal" pointer on the X yet.

They should be easily visible on variety of backgrounds, and serve me well. 
I made them and use them at 1024x768 screen resoulution, therefore they may look too big and clumsy on lower resolutions.


To install them 
1) make a directory called X in your y:\os2\pointers directory, where y: is your boot drive ( ie. something like c:\os2\pointers\X )
2) copy all of the files included in this archive there
3) open your MOUSE settings palette (It is located in your SYSTEM SETUP folder)
4) click on the POINTERS tab
5) click on LOAD SET ... button
6) choose X
7) Enjoy!

To uninstall 
1) open your MOUSE settings palette
2) click on the POINTERS tab
3) click on LOAD SET ... button
4) choose BLACK (default set of pointers)
5) delete the X pointers and remove the X directory

This set is of course public domain, so use'em and abuse'em to your heart's content.

ps. As a "bouns" I included a second ILLEGAL.PTR. So use the one you like. Remember that the one named ILLEGAL.PTR will be loaded as your poiter, so if you want the other you gotta rename it to ILLEGAL.PTR.
