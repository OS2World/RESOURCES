Transparent Pointer Set for OS/2

This is a set of mouse pointers.  The idea is that i don't like my
pointers to be very obvious on the screen.  I like them to be
unobtrusive, yet still highly functional.  This set is basically the
standard OS/2 pointer set which has been modified to be transparent.
It uses the "inverse" attribute exclusively.  And most of the
pointers tend to be slightly smaller than the original due to the
removal of the outlines.

It works for me!

Installation:

If you are not familiar with installing OS/2 pointer sets here is
briefly how it is done.  You will find a subdirectory under your
os/2 directory called 'ponters', like this: /os2/pointers/.  Under
that subdirectory there will be other subdirectories.  Each
subdirectory under the /pointers directory is one set of OS/2
pointers. 

You can create a new directory there and put all the *.ptr files in
it, or if you go to the /pointers directory and UNZIP this archive 
the directory should be made for you.

After that open MOUSE notebook in the the SYSTEM SETUP folder.
There is a tab on the book for pointer sets.  You can load it from
there.
