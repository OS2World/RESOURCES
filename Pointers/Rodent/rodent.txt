                             Rodent Pointers
                             ===============

 This is a set of pointers for use with OS/2. They were created using
OS/2 warp during one lunch hour, and come from a belief that a mouse
pointer should look like a small, furry animal.

 Copy the file rodent.zip into the root directory of your boot drive
(usually c:). You will need a program such as info-zip's unzip 5.12 to
unpack the file. Type

     unzip rodent

this will install the pointers in \os2\pointers\rodent. Now click with
your right mouse button on the backdrop, select system setup from the
menu, double click on mouse, and the mouse settings notebook will
appear. Select pointers, and on the pointers page click on Load Set.
Choose Rodent from the list, and click on load. When you have stopped
laughing close the notebook.

 Note that for all the pointers except text the "hot spot" is the
centre of the mouse's nose, and that in the wait state the mouse goes
to sleep (eyes closed and ears folded, blood suppy to nose reduced).

 These pointers are copyright Robert Billing, Tanglewood, Pinehill
Road, Crowthorne, Berks, UK, but individuals who are OS/2 users may
make use of them without charge. If you want to make commercial use of
them please contact me at the above address, or by e-mail to
