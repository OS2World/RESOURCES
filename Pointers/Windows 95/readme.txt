Disclaimer: If these pointers screw up your system in any way,
		    its your problem. =) They shouldn't but oh well...

These are 3d mouse pointers based on Win96.
They are different, for a change. I happen to
like the Win 96 interface, but not whats underneath
so I made these. These are the first pointers I've
ever made so, if anything is wrong just tell me!

If you enjoy them, you can email me @ bbaumg@megamed.com
