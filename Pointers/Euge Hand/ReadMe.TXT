Euge's Pointers for OS/2 Warp - volume 1
========================================

    This is a collection of pointers which I have created to be used
with OS/2 Warp.  The "hands" collection is my design of hands which can
also be found in my collection of 3D icons called "EUGEICO2.ZIP", which
can be found in /multimedia/icons.  Please take a look at these icons
which come in both 32x32 and 40x40 hi-res formats.


***********************************************************************
* NOTE:  IN ORDER TO UNPACK THE EUGEPTRS.ZIP YOU NEED TO UNZIP THEM   *
*        WITH THE "CREATE STORED DIRECTORIES" OPTION WITH WHATEVER    *
*        DECOMPRESSION UTILITY THAT YOU ARE USING.                    *
*        (InfoZIP's UNZIP does this automatically - PKUNZIP doesn't   *
***********************************************************************


    In order to implement these pointers in OS/2,
you need to make a new directory in the "x:\OS2\POINTERS\"
directory (like "eugehand"), and copy all the files (*.PTR) in the "pointer"
directory to the "x:\OS2\POINTERS\EUGEHAND" directory.
    Then from the OS/2 System folder, in the System Setup folder, choose the
"Mouse" control panal.  From there you can pick the "pointers" tab, and load
the "EugeHand" pointer set.


    I am still working on icons/pointers, and I will be uploading
stuff from time to time.  Look out for more stuff to come.  I hope you like
them.

HYPOTHESIS : All sin is forgiveable.
LEMMA :      The only unforgiveable sin, is sin that isn't given up to Christ
             for forgiveness.

PROOF :
   Sin => Sin
   Redemption => not(Sin)
   Sin & Jesus' Blood => not(Sin)
  therefore
   Sin & Jesus' Blood => Redemption

note: The "not(Sin)" implies that sin is washed away.
      Don't hold on to your sins, wash it away with the Blood of Jesus.
