	This is simply two sets of pointers that I like a lot.  Both sets are
farily large (you probably will find them too big on anything less than 
1024x768 -- I run at 1280x1024).  The Star Trek pointers I created myself,
based on a neato little bitmap that is running around the net (any trekker
websurfer is sure to have seen it.)  The White Glove pointers I modified from
a set I found on the net a few months ago, so that now it's a little more 
colorful, and you can actually tell what some of the pointers (particularly 
the wait and text) are now.  They look kinda like Mickey Mouse's hands.

Installation:

Simply unzip this archive into your OS2/POINTERS directory (make sure to
include "-d" on the command line if using PKZIP!)  This will create two
directories: "StarTrek" and "WGloves".  These can then be loaded from the mouse
control panel.

To do this,
  right click on desktop
  select "System Setup"
    (alternatively, open your System Setup folder)
  double click on the "Mouse" icon
  select the "Pointers" tab
  select the "Load Set..." button
  you will be given a menu which now includes the two entries "StarTrek" and
    "WGloves" (if you unzipped it properly).
  Select "StarTrek" or "WGloves" from the menu to change your mouse cursors!

That's all there is to it!

Standard Disclaimer:

I take no responsibility for anything.  If you use it, you deal with the
consequences.  (Though I have no idea how pointers could mess up your system --
unless, of course, you screw up in installing them)  I take no responsibility
for any loss of information, profits, sanity, or time.

If you like these, let me know!
