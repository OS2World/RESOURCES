I found a cigar pointer that looked like a Fuente years ago.  It just didn't 
seem like enough so I created the sizing elements to look like a Zino cigar nipper.  Due to a hard drive crash earlier this year these are all original.

I hope you like them.  I am releasing them into public domain, and ushering them 
into the smoking room.  In the words of King Edward when he assumed the throne, 
"Gentelmen, you may smoke".

Unzip this into your \os2\pointers directory and select
your mouse object and pointers, then cigar.
