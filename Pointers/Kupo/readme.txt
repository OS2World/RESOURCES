	Kupoptr Pointer Set for OS/2

Here's an interesting variation of the standard pointer set that I made
late one night while on IRC. Distribute and modify freely.

How to install:
1) Make a subdirectory under OS2\POINTERS called Kupo
2) Move this Zipfile there and unzip it
3) Go to your mouse icon under System Setup
4) Choose "Load Pointer Set"
5) Load the Kupo pointer set.

Hope you like it.
