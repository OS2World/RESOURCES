These are the animated update of my popular (OK, I got one email but I still
like them.) Ladybug mouse pointers.  I stole the 3d red pointers from the
Merlin distribution but the arrow, illegal, and wait pointers are mine.

You must have Animouse or the Animated Mouse Pointer for OS/2 package
installed to use these pointers properly.  If you have the proper program
installed you can just copy the ladybug.and file to your OS2\pointers
subdirectory and load it as a pointer set.  I have also included the .PTR
files so that they can be edited or changed into a static mouse pointer set.
If you edit my pointers, send me a copy. I might like your modifications
better than my own.

All I ask is that you send me an email with your comments, impressions,
praise, etc... to lgrossm@ceatlabs.okstate.edu
