This set of grey 3D-pointers for OS/2 was derived from another set of pointers (which were converted by Martin H. Speiser (100013.1276@compuserve.com)) as was part of this README file ;-). The original set that can be found on Hobbes as SOLIDPTR.ZIP has been released as freeware for unlimited use, so this set is, too.

I liked some the original set's pointers, but I thought that they needed a bit more 3D-effect, so I added another grey colour. Also, the size pointers didn't look very, hm, elegant. The new ones are much better :-). BTW, modifying the pointers or creating new ones using the old as a template was quite easy, so if you don't like your pointers be creative and try yourself!

Installation (for OS/2 Warp):
-----------------------------

The pointer set is purposely contained within a subdirectory within 
the ZIP file.  The easiest method is to *drag* the folder, and drop 
it into \OS2\POINTERS - of course, you could just unzip the file 
inside \OS2\POINTERS, but if you are reading this text, you must 
have already unzipped the file, so the folder is already sitting there 
waiting to be dragged.  :-)

Then, open the OS/2 SETTINGS folder (click with the right mouse
button on an empty spot on the desktop, then click on System Setup).
Open the MOUSE object, and click on the POINTERS tab.  Click on "Load
Set", select the new set, then click on LOAD - that's it!

There are some alternatives for the arrow, wait and illegal pointers. To use them as part of the set you need to rename them. Or you can just drag a pointer to the POINTERS tab.
