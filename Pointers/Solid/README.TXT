A collection of pointers for OS/2 Warp, converted 
by Martin H. Speiser (100013.1276@compuserve.com).

Installation (for OS/2 Warp):

The pointer set is purposely contained within a subdirectory within 
the ZIP file.  The easiest method is to *drag* the folder, and drop 
it into \OS2\POINTERS - of course, you could just unzip the file 
inside \OS2\POINTERS, but if you are reading this text, you must 
have already unzipped the file, so the folder is already sitting there 
waiting to be dragged.  :-)

Then, open the OS/2 SETTINGS folder (click with the right mouse
button on an empty spot on the desktop, then click on System Setup).
Open the MOUSE object, and click on the POINTERS tab.  Click on "Load
Set", select the new set, then click on LOAD - that's it!

These pointers are released as freeware for unlimited use.
