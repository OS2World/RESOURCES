OS/2.cz I-Collection I
======================

WHAT IS IT?
===========

This collection contains about 800 high-resolution icons! I tried to choose the
best icons from a lot of collections around... (I have more than 11,000 icons
on my HPFS drive (what about FAT? :-) and these are the best...I think)

The icons are divided into folders by its filenames

The folder BeOS contains icons from BeOS (my favourite ones ;-) )

There is also one icon from our production - OS/2.cz icon :-)

I hope youïll enjoy this collection!

Any suggestions mail to: molcanf@seznam.cz
