Free-D Warp icons
=================

For those of us not lucky enough to participate in the Merlin beta,
here are some icons that will give your Desktop just a hint of the
snazzy 3-D look from the new version of Warp.

Please note that these are NOT the real McCoy; that is to say, these
icons HAVE NOT been lifted from actual Merlin resources. I saw a Merlin
screen shot, decided I liked the look, and started doodling. These are
all either completely hand-drawn, or hand-drawn combined with clippings
from OS/2 2.x and 3.0 icons.

Most of the icons are for folders, with a few other key objects tossed
in. This is because most of Warp's other objects (drives, printers, etc.)
look sufficiently 3-D to work well with the new-style folders--especially
considering I don't want to be drawing icons all year. :-)

All icons include versions for the following display formats:
	Independent Color Form (VGA)
	Independent BW Form
	Independent Small Color Form
	Independent Small BW Form
	XGA/8514 Small Color Form
	XGA/8514 Small BW Form
	XGA/8514 16 Colors
	XGA/8514 256 Colors
Note that "XGA" just means the size of the icon is 40x40 pels instead
of 32x32 pels. The "Small" forms are the ones that appear on the control
menu when the object is open. (For books, this applies to the Settings
view only, since VIEW.EXE supplies the control menu icon when reading
the document.)

Enjoy. No payment required, no postcards, no nothin'; just drag,
drop and say "Thanks, Ron." If you add to the collection, feel
free to send me the new files at rjgamin@ix.netcom.com. If I like
them, I'll update the archive and give you full credit.
