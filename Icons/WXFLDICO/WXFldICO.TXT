One of the nicest features exclusive to WebExplorer and the Workplace
Shell is the ability to drag-and-drop URLs for web pages.  These URL
objects can be nicely organized into folder trees, leaving Netscrap's
bookmarks in the dust.

Since I run almost everything from my LaunchPads (plural - see
ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/wpsutil/newpad.zip) *without* text on the pads
or drawers, I needed a little something more than a plain-jane folder
for my URLs.

So I made these.

Easiest way to use'em is to unzip'em onto your Desktop (if your system
is installed on C:, use UNZIP WXFldICO -d C:\DESKTOP), then open the
Settings for the folder you keep your URLs in and drag-n-drop'em into
the General pages (you should know how to do this by now).
