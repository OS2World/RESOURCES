
Here's an updated collection of Be Icons.  There are a total
of 132 icons--and all of them are really nice.

These icons taken from screenshots of the BeOS on the Be
homepage (http://www.be.com/) and from a couple of Be Icon
collections for Windows.

If you like these icons, check out the GreatIcons.zip file
on Hobbes.  It has a few more collections of 256 color icons,
including a Looney Toons, Far Side, Danger Mouse, 
Wallace&Grommit, Total Eclipse, World of Copland, and Cool
Folders icons.  And keep an eye out at Hobbes for icon
collections that I'm in the middle of converting...
