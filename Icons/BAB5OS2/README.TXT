Dear Icon Mavens:

No longer confined to 16 colors, I have created these 256 color 
icons.  They are ideal for using on any application, though the 
Bab5 demo application is the one I originally for which was inspired to 
make an icon.  Beware:  These icons are 256 COLORS, and may not 
be read by some icon editing programs.  They sould otherwise 
work well.  The icons were created using the TIM system.  

All likenesses, etc are the property of their respective 
owners.  So don't send any money, or they will get mad. Thanks,

Rob Kiser
