I have uploaded these to Hobbes so they don't get lost.  The eComstation Classic Grey Folders theme
will be included in a future release of eCS 2.0.

These are additional icons I have created for the "eComstation Classic Grey" itheme for eCS 2.0

The eComStation Classic Grey is an itheme replacing the standard folders with a new style folder sets.

Feel free to add to the package and upload to Hobbes.
