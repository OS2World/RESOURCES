Hello,

     I hope you enjoy the folders.  As you can see, I have pulled images
from several diffrent sources to create these folders.  Unfortunatley, I
have not had the time to complete the 32X32 versions, but I hope to soon.

     You may distribute the FOLDERS.ZIP file as much as you like.  I only
ask that you keep this README-1.TXT file with the folders.

     If you love, hate, have ideas, or want to yell at me for using one
of your icons in this collection, drop me a line.
