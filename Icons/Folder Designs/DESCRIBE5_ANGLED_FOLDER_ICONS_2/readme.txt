First, David Graser deserves any credit for these, as all I did was take his "blank" folder icons from new_ecs_angled_folder_icons_release5.zip and use ICONEDIT.EXE to scribble in the "D" as it appeared in the original DeScribe folder icon. I tweaked the color a bit, and repeated the process for the open view of the folder.

Don't ask me why I did this. I was bored, my eyes hurt from too much screen reading, and big blocks of color seemed soothing at the time. :-)

Enjoy, and remember to drop David a note of thanks for all of his beautiful artwork for OS/2 and eCS over the years.
