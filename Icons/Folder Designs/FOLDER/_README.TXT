Hello,

     I hope you enjoy the folders.  I now have over 600 folders in 6 sub-directories.  As you can see, I have pulled images from several diffrent sources to create these folders (primarily ICONDE-Edwards, FLDRCONS-Chamblee, and MOREICO-Harold).  Unfortunatley, I have not yet completed all of the 32X32 versions.

     You may distribute the FOLDERS.ZIP file as much as you like.  I only
ask that you keep this _README.TXT file with the folders.
