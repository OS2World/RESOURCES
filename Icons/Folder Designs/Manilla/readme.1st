I have uploaded these to Hobbes so they don't get lost.  The Manilla Envelope itheme will be included in a future release of eCS 2.0.

These are additional icons I have created for the "Envelope" itheme for eCS 2.0

Manilla envelope folders is an itheme replacing the standard folders with a new style folder sets.

Also included is a template for those that want to make their own icons.

Feel free to add to the package and upload to Hobbes.
