Salutations!!!
Make your machine more COLORFUL...AND easier to navigate!!!
This is the SECOND installment of FolderCons!

In the first installment, some users only saw plain(32x32) folder icons. :-( Sorry.

I have now made 32x32 versions of the FolderCons.

my EXCUSE...
 Most OS/2 icons contain (at least) both sizes: Independent VGA 32x32 16 color
and 8514 40x40 16 color.
  I only use the screen resolution of 1024x768 on my machines. At this
resolution, all icons are the 40x40 type. This is why, in the previous package
of FolderCons, I only had 40x40 icons prepared. Most of these icons are still
40x40.
  If you are not using a screen resolution that displays 40x40 icons,
use the icon editor to view all the icon sizes. If you have some free time,
PLEASE convert some more to 32x32. Let me know if you convert any...I'll
include them and give YOU credit!

This package contains the following directories...

FldrCons            contains 32x32 & 40x40 icons (below 1024x768 res. users can SEE!!!)
FldrCons\no32x32    contains only 40x40 icons(PLEASE! help convert more)

Respond at will...
