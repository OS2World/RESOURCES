These are a bunch of 256 color icons I've made up for various games I have.
Most of them are from screen shots, with touching up.  A few, like the
lemmings and third courier icons, are mostly articstic talent :-)

I run in 800x600x256, so these icons will probably not look good at other
resolutions, or fewer colors.  A few have 8514 icons too, but only a few.

Enjoy!
