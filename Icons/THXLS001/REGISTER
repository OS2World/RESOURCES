How to register think::xels!

Any license must be registered. Your Software will be registered
automatically, if you purchased via BMT or Compuserves Registration
Service (GO SWREG).

If you have purchased a license, you will get an eMail with the
license you've purchased. This eMail is filled out with your Name
and if you've purchased a non 'Unlimited License' an Applicationname.
Both, the Fax and the eMail are signed with an encryption software.
This is your license; store it in a save place and handle it as
any other legal document.

If you have obtained an evaluation copy of the Software, and have
not purchased a license to the Software, 'edv-beratung wimmers'
grants you a 30-day non-exclusive license to use 'think::xels!'
free of charge for the purpose of evaluating whether you wish
to purchase an ongoing license for the Software.

After these 30 days you must purchase a license or you must
deinstall all parts of 'think::xels!.'

Have fun!

Your think::now! - Team.
