Euge's 3-Dimensional Icons for OS/2 Warp - volume 3
===================================================

    Well, here it is, my 3rd volumn of icons.  This, unlike my last volume
(volume 2) is a totally new set of icons.  I've had a lot of fun creating this
set, which I hope is somewhat creative and unique.

    Along with some updated icons (a more 3 dimensional toolbox...), I've
included some icons that look like buildings.  Along with these icons, I've
included some bitmaps of street layouts.  I call this the ObjectTown scheme.

    To utilise/create an ObjectTown, create a new folder (or even use the
desktop) and open up the settings notebook.
- copy the bitmaps (road?.bmp) to the \os2\bitmap directory
- select the background tab, and set the background bitmap to one of the
  road? files.
- you may want to make the "view" of the icon fonts invisible (on the first
  page).  This will make the map look a lot more Object Oriented.
- resize the window view of the "Object town" folder to fill the background
  with the bitmap unscaled.
- now move some folders/objects into the map, or create new folders and objects
- change the icons for the new objects/folders to that of a building (you may
  want to alter the houses, to distinguish them (ie. colour, or inclusion of
  smaller icons).  Included are pairs of buildings and objects, one denoting
  a closed folder, and the other denoting an opened folder.
- I've also created some other objects, like a telephone pole (communications
  folder), which are also to be included in ObjectTown
- ObjectTown has now been created.  I hope that this influences the creation
  of more objects, that can be included.

I've included a snapshot of an ObjectTown folder that I've created.  It's
the "OOTown.BMP" or "OOTown.GIF" file.  Most of the things that you see
in this file is an object, like the church, the houses, the satellite dish,
the telephone pole...

- with a utility like PRIVF (private folders) (I'm not too sure if this
  utility works on Warp or not... I'll have to check), you can lock these
  folders (er... buildings) so that certain people can only go into certain
  houses.

Now, how's that for Object Oriented!  It's much better than just Windows.
Now you can have 'rooms' and even 'buildings'.  It's helping me organize
myself, and since quite a few other people use my computer, I can trust that
they will only have access to their own 'homes', unless I lend them my 'keys'.


All the icons have been created for use in both low-res (32x32) and hi-res
(40x40) environments, except for the ObjectTown stuff (which I'll try to have
done for my next release).  I've kept all the icons, and the BMPs to a 16
colour format, for ease of use on most platforms, and for load time.  Some of
you out there might want something more, like 256 colour landscape.  Well,
maybe I'll try working on that, but hey, this is still in the early stages.
Let me know what you think.


Please send forth any ideas that might perk my interest.  Let's see how far we
can take OS/2's _AWESOME_ Object Oriented Desktop!  I'd love to hear your
comments and constructive criticism.

God Bless, and I hope to hear from you.

HYPOTHESIS : All sin is forgiveable.
LEMMA :      The only unforgiveable sin, is sin that isn't given up to Christ
             for forgiveness.

PROOF :
   Sin => Sin
   Redemption => not(Sin)
   Sin & Jesus' Blood => not(Sin)
  therefore
   Sin & Jesus' Blood => Redemption

note: The "not(Sin)" implies that sin is washed away.
      Don't hold on to your sins, wash it away with the Blood of Jesus.
