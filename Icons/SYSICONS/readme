The files in this ZIP are ICONs.  There is one file for each ICON
distributed with OS/2 2.0 and contained in PMWP.DLL.  OS/2 relates these
ICONs to system objects such as folders, drives, printers, servers,
etc.

A simple way to see how OS/2 associates ICONs to system objects is to
examine the INI.RC file in the \OS2 directory.  This file is used with
MAKEINI.EXE to rebuild the OS2.INI file when it gets damaged.  Within
the INI.RC file, an ICON is associated with an object using a specific
ICON resource.  For example:

"PM_InstallObject" "Information;WPFolder;<WP_DESKTOP>"
  "HELPPANEL=13092;ICONRESOURCE=60 PMWP;ICONPOS=5 57;OBJECTID=<WP_INFO>"

The name of each ICON file in this ZIP is in the format OS2RESnn.ICO
where nn is the PMWP.DLL ICON resource number.  Using the example above,
you can view ICONRESOURCE=60 by displaying OS2RES60.ICO using the ICON
Editor or the File Manager.
