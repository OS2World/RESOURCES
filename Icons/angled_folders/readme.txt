This package contains new eCS angled folders.  Most were created to replace the old Warp style folder icons found in older OS/2 programs.  I have also created a few new system folders in case anyone finds the new ones more appealing than the older ones.

A special thanks to Sander Nyman for his critical analysis of my original test release.  He has also included folder icons he has created like Electron Teller and Lotus.

Feel free to use, or modify as you so chose.  Developers are welcome to use the icons in their programs if they so chose.


Use at your own risk.

Enjoy!
