This is obviously a Zipfile of various STAR WARS icons I made. They were 
desined on Icon Designer by an unknown author. I hope you enjoy having these
icons on your STAR WARS desktop.

The icons included, are:

ALLILOG1 ICO  The basic logo, on a white background.  
ALLILOG2 ICO  Same as above, on a blue background.
ARTOO    ICO  This icon is a rendition of the famous R2-D2. Mind you, this 
              is a very basic representation.
AWING    ICO  This icon is of the speed-demon of the Alliance in action.
BLASTER  ICO  Han's favorite DL-44 blaster pistol.
BWING    ICO  The frigate killer in action.
C3PO     ICO  The talkative droid comes to your screen, sort of.
DARTH    ICO  Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader. Also, very basic 
              rendition.
FALCON   ICO  Han's favorite ship in an icon.
IMPLOGO  ICO  No mistaking this logo, striking fear in the minds of 
              millions.
LTSAB1   ICO  Luke's replacement 'saber. A good one, but limited.
LTSAB2   ICO  A duel between two 'saber blades.
LTSAB3   ICO  This is Anakin Skywalker's 'saber, given to Luke. Very good 
              'saber, but lost during their battle.
NRLOGO   ICO  A logo for the New Republic. Based on various sources.
STDESTR  ICO  The massive ships that the Empire loves so much.
STRMTROP ICO  A rendition of a cloned??? troop that will serve the Emperor's
              every will.
SWLOGO   ICO  This is the logo that we ALL know and love. 
T_A      ICO  The Empire's speed demon, as flown by Darth Vader himself.
T_B      ICO  The mass destroyer of ship-to-ship combat.         
T_F      ICO  This fighter wins by number, supposedly.  
T_I      ICO  The final version, as seen later in the Trilogy.
XWING    ICO  Basic space superiority vessel, that carries Luke to victory.       
YWING    ICO  The alliance's answer to delivering warheads quickly.       
        
Well, here are the icons, now unzip them into a directory of your choice. 
The Windows directory would be helpful, but not necessary. That's it, you 
can now use them for whatever programs you feel like using them on. Please 
tell me what you think, I can ALWAYS make more.
