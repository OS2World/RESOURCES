JOEICONS.ZIP -- A collection of OS/2 2.x icons

-----------------------------------------------

Every time I find myself installing an OS/2 beta I end up wading through 
approximately 1 Megabyte worth of zipped icons.  The handful I have included
here have become my favorite and most-often used choices.  Several of these
have appeared elsewhere, while others are taken from Windows 3.1 and still 
others are original creations.
