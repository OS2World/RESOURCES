As some people believe they must unnecessarily enlarge their OS2.INI by using 
truecolor icons, even more they tend to make me believe that using less than 
highcolor is not 21th century alike I sat down...

Have a look by yourself, compare it to available truecolor icons and then judge 
by yourself

I don't mind if you throw it away, natuarlly I would like mor if you decide to 
go with.
