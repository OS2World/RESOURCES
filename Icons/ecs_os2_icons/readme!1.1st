I have created some ecs/os2 icons. I have also created some substitute "system setup program icons". These are not folder icons. Some were originally included in the ecs_os2_folder_icons package.  Due to the number of none folder icons I have created, I have removed the icons into their own package. Feel free to modify and use the icons as you so desire. Enjoy.  As always, use at your own risk.
