These are some (mostly) 16 colour icons for a TeX/LATeX package.
They really require only three colours (black, white and dark grey)
so they should be fairly independant of the pallete even on 16
colour displays. The icon files also include monochrome versions.

As of Tues. 8 Mar, 1994, this package should contain:
 Size   EA's
 3498   187  TeX-BIBTeX.ICO
 3498   186  TeX-LaTeX.ICO
 5528    22  TeX-fold.ICO
 3498   159  TeX.ICO
 3498    50  TeXdoc.ICO

As far as I'm concerned these are public domain.
