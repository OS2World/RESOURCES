             THE OS/2 Icon Collection #10 - Standard .ICO Edition
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Archive Filename: ticn10ic.zip (Mar. 23, 1996)

Description: This is THE OS/2 Icon Collection #10, *Standard .ICO* edition.
             It contains over 3700 (3765 to be exact) OS/2 icons, many of them
             unavailable elsewhere.  IMHO, this is the best ensemble of OS/2
             2.x/3.0 icons on the Internet!

What's Changed in this Release?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Release 10 introduces 390 new/improved icons from various sources
(Ray Appleby, Horst Kiehl, Brad Wardell, myself, as well as others).  It's
a shame that it took 7 months to come up with this update, but then I have
other things to do besides organizing/making icons.  ;)  The next one will
arrive after the release of Merlin in July, with future updates in six-
month intervals...

Why 3 Different Editions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE OS/2 Icon Collection is available in three formats:

- Dave Lester's IconEase format (IconEase Edition: ticn10ie.zip)
  * Requires IconEase 2.02 - ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/graphics/icone202.zip

- Paul van Keep's Icon Heaven format (Icon Heaven Edition: ticn10ih.zip)
  * Requires Icon Heaven 1.12 - ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/incoming/fih112.zip
                                             *to be moved to*
                                ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/wpsutil/fih112.zip

- OS/2 .ICO format (Standard .ICO Edition: ticn10ic.zip)
  * Requires 16MB of space on an HPFS partition (needed for long filenames)

Generally, .ICO format is for those using HPFS who also happen to have huge
HDs.  It's recommended to use one of the first two formats; although they
require special programs to access the icon collection, the savings in disk
space (up to 61% in my case) is well worth the small effort in setting them
up!

Rationale for Existence:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Q: The overall quality of the icons in OS/2 Warp Version 3 is much higher
    than those in OS/2 2.x, why would I want to waste several megabytes of
    disk space in storing these icons?
 A: Good point.  I don't know why, but people (at least me and my friends)
    seem to be obsessed with getting their desktops look unique and cool,
    thus justifying the presence of "THE OS/2 Icon Collection" on their hard
    drives...  ;)

Disclaimers:
~~~~~~~~~~~
     You may find some of the icons in this file are seen in other icon
libraries available on various FTP sites.  It is because I selectively chose
them from other collections in an attempt to create a "One Library for All"
OS/2 icon compilation to ease the burden of people who are new to OS/2 or
Internet, so that they can get started in exploring the power of OS/2 without
worrying whether they've got all the "good" icons or not.  Some icons are
also extracted from different WWW homepages, not to mention the company logos.
Should you find any of the icons included in ticn10ic.zip infringe your
copyright, feel free to e-mail me, and the icon(s) in question will be
removed promptly.  I fully respect the idea of intellectual property, and
would do my part to protect it.

     Since this icon collection is distributed free of charge, there is no
warranty for it of any kind.  USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  In no event I would
be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental,
consequential, physical, and psychological damages arising out of the use
or inability to use the icons (including but not limited to loss of precious
disk space or time or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure
of the icons to display decently on your 640x480/800x600 desktop), even if
I have been advised of the possibility of such damages. (whew!  Was that
long or what?)  IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT FLAMING ME IF YOU
THINK THE ICONS SUCK (many OS/2ers do resent using 32x32x16 icons - those
converted from Windows, basically); INSTEAD, DRAW/IMPROVE/ENHANCE SOME ICONS
TO REPLACE THEM!  I'm only maintaining this archive in good will, and I expect
nothing but appreciation of my effort, which is open to interpretation... ;-)

Instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I) How to decompress ticn10ic.zip properly:
          To decompress the icons with the EAs intact, use Info-ZIP's Unzip
          (version 5.12 - ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/archiver/unz512x2.exe).

 II) How to install the package:
          Just unzip ticn10ic.zip to a new directory (use a descriptive name),
          and run the installation script (Install.CMD) to create a shadow
          object of the icon folder on your OS/2 Desktop.  It is highly
          recommended to use an HPFS partition for icon storage, as many files
          will NOT be extracted under FAT (yes, I could have renamed those
          files using EA .LONGNAME so that they appear under WPS with long
          names, yet retaining 8.3 physical filenames; I didn't do so because
          I don't have that much time).

III) How to utilize the icons:
          If you don't know how to assign icons to objects under OS/2, run
          the tutorial to acquaint yourself with the basics.

 IV) How to make new icons:
          In the Templates folder (not the one on your desktop), drag from
          the icon templates listed below and drop onto the destination
          folder to create blank icons; double-click on the new icons to
          invoke the OS/2 Icon Editor for editing.

          24-bit Icon (w/ Small Colour Forms).ICO
               32x32 and 40x40 at 24-bit colour depth
          24-bit Icon (w/o Small Colour Forms).ICO
               32x32 and 40x40 at 24-bit colour depth, plus their small
               colour form counterparts (16x16 and 20x20, respectively)
          8-bit Icon (w/ Small Colour Forms).ICO
               32x32 and 40x40 at 8-bit colour depth
          8-bit Icon (w/o Small Colour Forms).ICO
               32x32 and 40x40 at 8-bit colour depth, plus their small
               colour form counterparts (16x16 and 20x20, respectively)
          Standard Forms Icon.ICO
               Independent Color Form (=VGA) - 32x32x16
               Independent Small Color Form - 16x16x16
               Independent Small BW Form - 16x16x2
               XGA/8514 - 16 colors - 40x40x16
               XGA/8514 Small Color Form - 20x20x16
               XGA/8514 Small BW Form - 20x20x2
               Independent BW Form (=1.1 format) - 32x32x2

  V) Hi-Res icons:
          40x40 icons requires OS/2 2.x and up to be running at 1024x768 or
          higher resolutions to be displayed properly.  For systems with
          lower resolutions the quality of some icons might not be that
          good, since 32x32 simply can't do justice to some highly-detailed
          images.
