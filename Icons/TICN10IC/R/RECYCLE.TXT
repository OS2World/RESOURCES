===========================================================================

I was looking at my copy of Windows Sources and decided to try to draw
the Recycling bin icon on the cover that appears to be in the upcoming
"Chicago."  So I did.  Since the two GUI's are so similiar, I figured
that you could fool some naive Windows users by replacing your trash folder
with this icon and making a few other cosmetic changes.  Well, have fun.

Oh, of course it's free too.
