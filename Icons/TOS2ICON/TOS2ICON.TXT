This file contains two icon images: "open folder" and "close folder" icons; both have
Team OS/2 logo in it.  To change the icon of a folder (open/close), open the Settings notebook of the object and select the "General" tab page and just drap either icon image
to the "Current icon" area.  Just that simple!

Feel free to distribute among Team OS/2 members.
