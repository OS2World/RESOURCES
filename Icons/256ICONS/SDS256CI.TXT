This is the second set of SDS Icons released from Stardock Systems.

It is a collection of original icons that were mostly inspired from
System 7 of the Macintosh computer while others were taken from
popular video games that are on some of our customer's machines.

Note.  These will look "goofy" if you have less than 256 colors.

A new device has been created for these icons: "Super VGA".  It
is a resolution specificed of 32x32 (for icons) on systems up to but
not including 1024x768.  They have a pallette of up to 256 colors.

Some of the more useful icons have 8514 devices and "Tiny" Devices
(16x16).

If you experience any difficulties or have any comments please

If you like this set of icons, you may also like our enhanced VGA
set of icons "SDS Icons" which are icons with 16 colors in them but
have customized palletes for each one (meaning they will probably not
look good on non-256 color systems.

Stardock Systems is a Michigan based company that sells among other
things, OS/2 based computer systems at unsually low prices.
