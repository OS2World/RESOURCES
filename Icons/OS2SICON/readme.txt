        This collection of icons for OS/2 are the result of a long process,
making them a rather select group of icons unlike the ones you likely already       
have.  I downloaded all the Windows and OS/2 icons I could find, converted
the Windows icons to OS/2 format using CVTICONS (a DOS program), then
examined each one with an OS/2 icon program call ICON (file date 7/6/92).
This excellent program allows viewing, selectively deleting, and editing
(by double-clicking) any OS/2 icon.  I sorted through about 3500 icons,
deleted all but the best, and edited the remaining if they needed it.  On the
OS/2 Work Place Shell, an icon with an "inverse" background often looks
really bad if you have any pattern or picture as a WPS background.  Many
icons needed this inverse background replaced with a regular background; this
way, you simply see the simple object on the WPS.
        I plan to process more icons as I find them; I shall upload them to
most major OS/2 bulletin boards as well as to my adopted home BBS:  Channel 1, 
(617) 354-2505.
