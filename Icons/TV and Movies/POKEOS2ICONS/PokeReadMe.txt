This is 2 collections of Pokemon icons originally made for Win32 and
obtained from http://www.pokemoncentral.co.uk/.  The icons were
originally in the .icl Icon Library format.  I used Icon Grabber
to extract them to .ico and PM View 2000 to convert the Windows
icons to OS/2 format.  Unfortunately, Icon Grabber did a poor job
of extracting the icons so many of the converted icons are low
quality :-(       --- Pikachu
