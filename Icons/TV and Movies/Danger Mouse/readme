

This is a really nice collection of OS/2 icons.  Most have 
been converted from the Iconfactory.  Some are from the Be
Homepage.  And a few are my own customizations...

In this zip file you'll find:



Be Icons:
Icons taken from screenshots of the BeOS and the Be homepage.
   http://www.be.com/



Cool Folders:
DangerMouse Icons:
Farside Icons:
Halloween Icons:
Looney Toons:
Total Eclipse:
Wallace & Grommit:
World of Copland:

Icons from the IconFactory.
   http://www.iconfactory.com/.



Miscellaneous Icons:
Just a couple of icons that I edited out of the other
packages.  (And I also added a couple folders to the Total
Eclipse package, like the voicetype folder)


More to come:
I'm in the middle of converting the rest of the iconfactory's
icons to OS/2 format.  Notably:  More farside icons, two
sets of star wars icons, charlie brown icons, and a pack of
weird iconmaniac icons, and some MacCPU icons.



And one last note:
I don't know the names of many of the characters depicted in
these icons.  If you can remember any of the danger mouse,
looney toons, or wallace and grommit characters, please let
me know.


Thanks,
