**********************FILE UPDATE 6-13-95 BY SAM BECKETT*******************
               CONVERTED ALL WINDOZE ICONS TO OS/2 WARP ICONS
Congratulations! You're the proud owner of the for-now-complete *updated* X-Files Cast PC icons. Enclosed you will find every major character in the X-Files. Everyone from Mulder and Scully to Krycek the Rat Boy. Even the Lone Gunmen! If you have any comments or know anyone I may have left out, or if you have some constructive criticisism, send it on its way to "Fox Mulder" at 76233,3331 or if you're on the Internet, send 'em to 76233.3331@compuserve.com. I hope you get many hours of enjoyment out of
these little icons. If you have any icons that you'd like to send to me, go
ahead all you compuserve folk (I'm not sure if there's a fee for me if I 
receive a file from someone off the Net.)! Maybe I'll put 'em all in a ZIP
file and upload them.

This new fine updated edition now has famous X-Files villians such as Eve, 
Tooms, and Duane Barry. It even has the long awaited EBE icon! Yes, 
this is the most extensive collection of X-Files icons!

Sincerely,
Mulder
