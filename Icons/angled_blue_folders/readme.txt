This package contains new BLUE eCS angled folders.  Most were created to replace the old Warp style folder icons found in older OS/2 programs.

Feel free to use, or modify as you so chose.  Developers are welcome to use the icons in their programs if they so chose.

These folder icons can be used with the "blue_ecs_angled_folder_theme_release1.zip" found on Hobbes.


Use at your own risk.

Enjoy!
