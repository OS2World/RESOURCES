This is a collection of icons that I have used to enhance the look of VisualAge C++ from
IBM.

Most of them are borrowed from the Be homepage (http://www.be.com), others are from
the Stardock collection (sdsicons.zip), and finally some are handmade by me.

I hope they can be of use to you :)

Best regards,
