Icons for OS/2 2.0
Jeffrey L. Howard

| Renamed one file that slipped by with a 9.3 character name.


The icons in this package are all of my own creation, based on designs of
others included in previous versions of OS/2, Macintosh System 7, or Windows.
They are intended to allow you to spice up your interface with more colorful,
yet hopefully not garish, icons that fit well in the environment. Several
Mac-style icons are included to facilitate the creation of a workarea that
simulates the Mac System 7 interface. (Hint: Create a folder, maximize it,
and make the Apple Logo the icon for that folder - then either shadow a hard
disk to the folder or create another folder with a hard disk icon on it.
Use the included Mac-style folders and control panel icons to complete the
effect. Oh, and don't forget the trash can!)

ICON TIPS AND TECHNIQUES:

1) If you want to make folders that always have a specific icon, either
   create a new template for that folder or change the icon of the existing
   Folder Template in the Templates folder. (From the General tab).

2) In the icon editor, stick to the Independent Form (VGA) and also add
   a 2-color 16x16 icon. All of the above icons are designed for VGA and
   do not include the 40x40 version for BGA or XGA. To make this, just
   open the icon in the Icon Editor, go to the Device List... and chose
   the Add.. pushbutton, then Customize. Fill in 40x40 as the Image Size
   and select 256 Colors. The Icon Editor will create the version for you -
   it may need some cleanup due to the 32 to 40 pixel conversion.

3) To have documents for Pagemaker that always have the Pagemaker document
   icon by default, change the Template for "Aldus Pagemaker 3.0
   Publication.PM3" so that its icon is the Pagemaker document icon.

4) The Adobe Type Manager palette icons were created to give a more
   integrated appearance with the color palette, Font Palette and 
   Schemes Palette. If you take the ATM icon from Win-OS/2, create a 16x16
   16-color version from the Icon Editor Device List, you can easily cut
   and paste the 16x16x16-color ATM onto Folders or the blank control panel
   included. This is a great technique for taking 32x32 icons and shrinking
   them for inclusion on a folder cover.
