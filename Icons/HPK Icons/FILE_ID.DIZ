HPK Icons version 2.0.1 for OS/2
................................

Over 70 carefully made icons containing
all standard image forms (to avoid
scaling), using the default 16-color
palette throughout (to minimize color
mixups due to programs changing the
display palette), including a blank
template. Some icon pairs are suited
well for folder animation. The icons
have descriptive (long) filenames.

The README file includes some
information about OS/2 icons in
general.
