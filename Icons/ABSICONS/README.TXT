This is a collection of 48 icons for OS/2 2.0.
The icons have a Mac like 3D look and are designed to look good on top of
almost any background color.

The following icons are not originally of my own design:

   FLDSYSTM.ICO    (Original was without 3D borders)
   PALCOLOR.ICO    (Template that I used for all of the PAL*.ICO icons)
   PALFONT.ICO
   DRIVES.ICO

They came with the OS/2 icon package that inspired the creation of these
icons. I like to thank the author of these icons (I have lost the original
file somehow and thus cannot pay credit where credit is due).



   HOW TO REPLACE THE DEFAULT ICONS

There are several methods to replace the icon of a desktop object.
The following method is the one I use:

1. Create a folder with the name 'Icons' and place it anywhere on the desktop
   or inside another folder.

2. Drag the icons to that folder.

3. Select an object of which you want to change the icon.

4. Open the Settings for that object and select 'General'.

5. Press 'Find' button. Another window should open.

6. Select 'Search all subfolders' radiobutton and press 'Find' button.
   A list containing all icons should appear.

7. Select the icon you want and press the 'OK' button. That 's it!



   IMPLEMENTING A GARBAGE BAG (TRASH CAN)

1. Create a folder on the desktop near the shredder and name it 'Garbage'.

2. Change the icon of that folder to the supplied garbage bag icon.
   (FLDTRASH.ICO)

3. Change the object type to template by checkmarking the template
   checkmark in the general settings.

4. Pull out your own disposable garbage bag from the newly created template
   and fill it with all kinds of garbage.

5. If you want to dispose of the garbage just put it in the shredder and get
   yourself a new garbagebag from the template.

(To automatically get a new garbage bag without the system asking you to enter
 another name set in the System setup on the title page the radiobutton to
 'Auto-rename object'.)
