 This archive contains Hard Drive icons I made to be used primarily on the new 
 OS/2 Warp Launch Pad.  Since chosing the Option of "Text In Drawers" made the 
 buttons really really huge and affected all drawers, I chose to make these 
 icons so I could still feel Warm and Fuzzy about which Drive I was choosing. 
 
 I have implemented both SVGA (40x40) Normal and Small Sized icon views as well
 as Independant VGA Normal and Small sized icon views for your Launch
 Padding pleasure.  I chose to not include CD-ROM drives since the original 
 icon filled the area and most people don't have multiple CD-ROMs to be 
 confused about.

 These are free to all fo use.
