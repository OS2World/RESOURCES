          TRIBAL TRASH ICONS FšR OS/2

---------------------------------------------------------

 Why always those kind of boring OS/2 desktops?

This archive contains 15 magic icons, copied and
restored from the oldest known pc in history.
Those icons will support the nervous user while
doing his/her bows to the system. All of those
have a leading "TT" in their filename.

And finally - cause I have to loose a name - all of
those funny icons oncemore in a "better-than-mac"
quality. This because nobody should think I cannot
do better. All of those with - yes, sure - with a
leading "MC" in their filename.

Have fun,
