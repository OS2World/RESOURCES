
Here's a nice collection of 19 Tin-Tin Icons.  

I found this collection on the web (the IconParade, 
http://home.earthlink.net/~webworm/) but I don't know who
the original author(s) are.

If you like these icons, check out the GreatIcons.zip file
on Hobbes.  It has a few more collections of 256 color icons,
including a Looney Toons, Far Side, Danger Mouse, 
Wallace&Grommit, Total Eclipse, World of Copland, and Cool
Folders icons.  Also, look at the BeIcons collection.  If you
poke around, you should also find a few more nice icon collections
there.

!!Unfortunately, I don't know the names of these characters.  (I
recognize Tin-Tin and Snowy, but what were the names of the
twins and the professor, etc?)  If you know, please tell me.

Thanks,
Emre |=^)
