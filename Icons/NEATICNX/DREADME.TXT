Here's some nifty picture icons I whipped up recently while testing
JoeView V1.2e Beta  6/18/93, "another image viewer for the OS2 operating
system running under PM.  Your hardware needs to be able to display 256
colors for this puppy to work".

Contact Joe Burkley at burkley@opus.nosc.mil, (128.49.60.1) for info
about this package.


When I figured out I could copy a displayed picture to the clipboard in 
JoeView, I thought I would try and paste the picture into the icon editor
that comes with O/S2.  It worked!  I had a couple hundred pictures in gif
and jpeg format I had saved from alt.binaries.pictures.misc (sorry-none from
a.b.p.erotica!) so I spent a little while loading them one by one into
JoeView, and then pasting them into the icon editor and saving them as icons.

I first set the type of icons to 8514 (256 colors), selected paste from the
edit menu, and then saved them.



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! TO ATTACH AN ICON TO A PROGRAM OBJECT OR ANY OBJECT !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First, have a window open on the desktop displaying the picture icons.

Open the settings book for the object you want to attach an icon to by:

        (the default way*) click on the object with the right mouse button
        (i.e., button 2); This displays the pop-up menu associated with that
        object; click on the little boxed arrow to the right of "Open",
        and select settings; the settings book is displayed with tabs;

Select the "General" tab; (this page shows a picture of the icon in use);

Select the "Find" button; this displays the "Find" page;

select "Locate"; the "Locate Folder" is displayed;
the window (folder) containing the picture icons will be in the list of
folders; select it; click on "OK"; the "Locate Folder" window disappears;
click on the "Find" button; the "Find Results - *" window will appear
showing the icons; select the one you want, and select the "OK" button;
and that's it;

The new icon should now appear as the object!  This should work.  It works
for me.  But I will point out that several times previous to this, I
couldn't figure out how to do it.  I kept getting a window saying it couldn't
find any of the specified objects in the folder selected.

Another thing I haven't got to work is to select the "Edit" button;
this brings up the icon editor, but HOW DO YOU GET THE CHANGES YOU MAKE IN
AN ICON'S APPEARANCE TO SHOW UP ATTACHED TO THE OBJECT????

*You can change the actions associated with the mouse buttons; see the
mouse settings program in the System Setup Folder, which is in the O/S2
System Folder on the desktop; I have described the default way of clicking
buttons on the mouse.
