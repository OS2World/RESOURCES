These folder icons differ from others available in that I have 
attempted to render the "opened" image with perspective. This
seems to add to the visual appeal of the animation.
   I have tried to keep the color schemes as simple as possible,
but many will probably not look very good with less than 256-
color displays. For those few icons that actually have a full 
256-color pallette, the common pallette is included (256.PAL).
   Each icon comes in three complete forms: Independent Color
(VGA or SVGA), Independent Small Color, and Independent Small
Black and White. The other forms are there for those who want 
to complete them; in particular, XGA forms are not completed.
I recommend following one of the available methods to patch
your video driver to use 32x32 icons at XGA (1024x768) and
higher resolutions.
